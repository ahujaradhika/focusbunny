# focusbunny
A website for the product focusbunny (a fidget spinner with a pen). The website advertises the product/displays its features and has Stripe setup to purchase the product. It's available [here](https://focusbunny.com/). 

If that doesn't work, it is also deployed using Github pages [here](https://ahujaradhika.github.io/focusbunny/index.html)
